### Package : 
`Tensorflow` &nbsp; ` Numpy`  &nbsp;` pandas` &nbsp;


### Note :
In my .py script, I used the following script to assign the task running on GPU 0.<br>

```
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = "0"
```
To reduce downloading time consumption, I upload a singel model with acc about 0.70688 and 0.70743 on private and public board<br>
