### Package : 
`Keras` &nbsp; ` Numpy`  &nbsp;` pandas` &nbsp; `gensim` &nbsp;


### Note :

To reduce download and prediction time consumption, I upload **a singel model** with acc about 0.828 on leaderboard, which could pass single and strong base lines. **It takes about 8 minutes for prediciton!!**<br>
The best performance in kaggle was achieved by ensembling 10 models (10 x 220 MB). The model structure was described in Report.pdf<br>

Usage<br>

```
bash hw4_test.sh <testing data> <prediction file>
```

### Best model architecture :
